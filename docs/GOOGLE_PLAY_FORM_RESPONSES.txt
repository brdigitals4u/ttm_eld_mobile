1. APP PURPOSE (500 characters max)
================================================================================

TTM Konnect is an Electronic Logging Device (ELD) mobile application designed for commercial vehicle drivers to comply with FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration) regulations. The app automatically records Hours of Service (HOS) logs, tracks vehicle movement, monitors duty status changes, and maintains compliance records required by federal law. It connects to ELD hardware via Bluetooth to capture real-time vehicle diagnostics, speed, odometer readings, and engine data. The app ensures drivers meet mandatory HOS requirements, prevents violations, and provides accurate logs for roadside inspections and regulatory compliance.

Character count: 497/500

2. LOCATION ACCESS DESCRIPTION (500 characters max)
================================================================================

The app requires background location access to automatically record vehicle movement and duty status changes as mandated by FMCSA regulations. When the app is minimized or the device screen is off, continuous location tracking ensures accurate HOS logs are maintained without driver intervention. This background tracking automatically detects when a vehicle begins moving, records location coordinates for each duty status change (driving, on-duty, off-duty), and maintains a complete audit trail required for compliance. Location data is used exclusively for FMCSA-compliant ELD functionality, including automatic driving time calculation, location stamps on log entries, and accurate odometer tracking. Without background location access, the app cannot meet federal ELD requirements.
