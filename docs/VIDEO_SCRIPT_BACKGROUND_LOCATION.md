# Video Script: Background Location Access for Google Play

## Video Title
"TTM Konnect - Background Location Access for ELD Compliance"

## Video Description (for YouTube)
This video demonstrates why TTM Konnect ELD app requires background location access. The app is an FMCSA-compliant Electronic Logging Device that automatically tracks Hours of Service (HOS) logs for commercial drivers. Background location tracking is mandatory for federal compliance and ensures accurate HOS records even when the app is minimized.

"While you're using the app, it continuously tracks your location using GPS. Watch what happens when I change my duty status. [Change status to Driving] The app automatically records the current location with this status change. [Change to On-Duty] Again, location is recorded. [Change to Off-Duty] And again.

### Scene 5: Background Location - The Key Feature (2:30 - 3:30)
**Screen:** Minimize app, show it's still tracking, reopen app
**Narration:**
"Here's the critical part: what happens when you're not actively using the app? Let me minimize the app now. [Minimize app] Even though the app is in the background, it continues tracking your location. This is essential because FMCSA requires that your HOS logs be maintained automatically, even when the app isn't open. Let me reopen the app after a moment. [Reopen app] As you can see, the app continued recording your location and vehicle movement while it was in the background. This ensures your logs stay accurate without you having to constantly open the app."

- Show app icon in recent apps
- Open Android Settings > Apps > TTM Konnect > Permissions
- Show "Location - All the time" is enabled

### Scene 6: Compliance and Logs (3:30 - 4:00)
**Screen:** Daily logs screen, HOS chart, log details with location
**Narration:**
"All of this location data is used exclusively for ELD compliance. When you view your daily logs, you'll see that every entry includes location coordinates. This is required by FMCSA regulations. The app uses location to automatically calculate driving time, record where you started and stopped, and maintain a complete audit trail for roadside inspections."

### Scene 7: Why Background is Required (4:00 - 4:30)
**Screen:** Compliance information, regulation reference
**Narration:**
"Without background location access, TTM Konnect cannot function as a compliant ELD device. Federal regulations require that ELDs automatically record vehicle movement and location, even when the driver isn't actively using the app. This ensures accurate, tamper-proof logs that meet FMCSA requirements."

**Visual Notes:**
- Show compliance badge or FMCSA logo
- Show text: "FMCSA Regulation 49 CFR Part 395"
- Return to dashboard
- Show app working normally
