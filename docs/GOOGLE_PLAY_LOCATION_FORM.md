# Google Play Location Permissions Form - Completed Responses

## 1. App Purpose (500 characters max)

**Response:**

TTM Konnect is an Electronic Logging Device (ELD) mobile application designed for commercial vehicle drivers to comply with FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration) regulations. The app automatically records Hours of Service (HOS) logs, tracks vehicle movement, monitors duty status changes, and maintains compliance records required by federal law. It connects to ELD hardware via Bluetooth to capture real-time vehicle diagnostics, speed, odometer readings, and engine data. The app ensures drivers meet mandatory HOS requirements, prevents violations, and provides accurate logs for roadside inspections and regulatory compliance.

## 2. Location Access Description (500 characters max)

**Response:**

The app requires background location access to automatically record vehicle movement and duty status changes as mandated by FMCSA regulations. When the app is minimized or the device screen is off, continuous location tracking ensures accurate HOS logs are maintained without driver intervention. This background tracking automatically detects when a vehicle begins moving, records location coordinates for each duty status change (driving, on-duty, off-duty), and maintains a complete audit trail required for compliance. Location data is used exclusively for FMCSA-compliant ELD functionality, including automatic driving time calculation, location stamps on log entries, and accurate odometer tracking. Without background location access, the app cannot meet federal ELD requirements.

## 3. Video Creation Guidance

### Overview
Google Play Store requires a YouTube video demonstrating the background location feature. The video must show the app using location in the background and explain why this permission is necessary.

### Video Requirements
- **Duration:** 2-5 minutes recommended
- **Format:** YouTube video (public or unlisted)
- **Content:** Must demonstrate background location tracking in action
- **Language:** English (or include subtitles)

### Video Script/Storyboard

#### Scene 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)
**Visual:** App icon and title screen
**Narration:** "TTM Konnect is an FMCSA-compliant Electronic Logging Device app for commercial drivers. This video demonstrates why the app requires background location access."

#### Scene 2: App Purpose (0:30 - 1:00)
**Visual:** Show dashboard screen with HOS clocks, duty status
**Narration:** "The app automatically tracks Hours of Service, records duty status changes, and maintains compliance logs required by federal regulations. Location tracking is mandatory for ELD compliance."

#### Scene 3: Location Permission Request (1:00 - 1:30)
**Visual:** Show location permission dialog, grant "Allow all the time" permission
**Narration:** "When you first use the app, it requests location permission. You must select 'Allow all the time' for background tracking, which is required for automatic HOS logging."

#### Scene 4: Active Location Tracking (1:30 - 2:30)
**Visual:** 
- Show dashboard with current location displayed
- Show map view with GPS coordinates
- Demonstrate changing duty status (driving, on-duty, off-duty)
- Show location being recorded with each status change
**Narration:** "While the app is open, location is tracked continuously. Each duty status change is automatically recorded with GPS coordinates, as required by FMCSA regulations."

#### Scene 5: Background Location Demonstration (2:30 - 3:30)
**Visual:**
- Minimize the app (show app going to background)
- Show device settings indicating location is still being accessed
- Open app again after 30 seconds
- Show that location data was recorded while app was in background
- Show HOS log entries with location stamps from background period
**Narration:** "When the app is minimized or your phone screen is off, location tracking continues in the background. This ensures your HOS logs remain accurate even when you're not actively using the app. The app automatically records your location when you start driving, change duty status, or stop the vehicle."

#### Scene 6: Compliance Features (3:30 - 4:00)
**Visual:**
- Show daily logs screen with location-stamped entries
- Show HOS chart with automatic driving time calculation
- Show location data in log details
**Narration:** "All log entries include location coordinates, which are required for FMCSA compliance. This data is used exclusively for ELD functionality and regulatory compliance."

#### Scene 7: Conclusion (4:00 - 4:30)
**Visual:** App icon, compliance badge
**Narration:** "Background location access is essential for TTM Konnect to function as a compliant ELD device. Without it, the app cannot automatically track vehicle movement or maintain accurate HOS logs as required by federal law."
